# WrikeTheme — Kanboard Plugin

A modern, minimalist theme for [Kanboard](https://kanboard.org) inspired by Wrike's clean project workspace aesthetic.  
Replaces Customizer, EssentialTheme, and Moon with a single self-contained plugin that includes syntax highlighting, a settings UI, per-user night mode, and login page branding.

## Requirements

- Kanboard **≥ 1.0.48**
- PHP **≥ 7.2**

---

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository into your Kanboard `plugins/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/kanboard/plugins
   git clone https://github.com/porquero/WrikeTheme-for-Kanboard
   ```

2. If you were using **Customizer**, **EssentialTheme**, or **Moon** — disable them in  
   **Settings → Plugins** before enabling WrikeTheme to avoid CSS conflicts.

3. Enable **WrikeTheme** in **Settings → Plugins**.

4. Reload the page — the theme is applied immediately.

---

## Configuration

### Option A — Settings UI *(recommended)*

Navigate to **Settings → WrikeTheme** in the Kanboard sidebar.

From there you can set:

- **Header background color** — color picker + hex input with live preview
- **Header title color** — color picker + hex input
- **Logo URL** — any accessible URL; leave empty for the default `KB` text logo
- **Default task color** — pre-selects this color whenever a new task is created

All settings are saved to the Kanboard database and take effect immediately on the next page load.

### Option B — Config file

Edit the file at `data/files/WrikeTheme/config.php` (created automatically on first run):

```php
<?php
// Logo image path — comment out to use the default "KB" text logo
$themeWrikeConfig['logo'] = '/plugins/WrikeTheme/Assets/images/brand-logo.png';

// Header background color
$themeWrikeConfig['backgroundColorHeader'] = '#293D52';

// Header title color
$themeWrikeConfig['headingTitleColor'] = '#FFFFFF';
```

> **Note:** Settings saved via the UI take precedence over the config file when both are present.

---

## Night Mode

Click the **moon icon** (🌙) in the top-right header bar to toggle night mode.

- The preference is saved **per-user in the database** — it persists when switching browsers or devices.
- The correct mode is applied **server-side on page load**, so there is no flash of the wrong theme.
- For unauthenticated pages (e.g. the login screen), `localStorage` is used as a fallback.

---

## Syntax Highlighting

WrikeTheme bundles [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting inside Markdown code blocks on task descriptions and comments. No additional setup is needed.

````markdown
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, Kanboard!")
```
````

## Replacing Legacy Plugins

WrikeTheme was built by studying the source code and architecture of three existing Kanboard plugins, which served as direct references and inspiration:

| Legacy plugin | What was referenced |
|---|---|
| **[Customizer](https://github.com/creecros/Customizer)** | Logo injection, header color config, login branding approach, settings UI pattern |
| **[EssentialTheme](https://github.com/JamesEadon/EssentialTheme)** | Full CSS theme structure and Kanboard selector conventions |
| **[Moon](https://github.com/functionland/moon)** | Prism.js integration, logo in header, config-file-based theming, layout template overrides |

WrikeTheme combines all of their features into a single self-contained plugin — disable all three before enabling WrikeTheme to avoid CSS conflicts.

## Changelog

### 1.1.2
- **Fix:** Night mode now persists correctly across page navigations. Root cause: the DB write failure (see 1.1.1) caused `layout.php` to output `data-night-mode="0"`, which the JS then used to overwrite `localStorage`, destroying the only remaining client-side fallback. Fix: JS now also writes a cookie (`wrikeThemeNightMode`) on every toggle. `layout.php` reads the cookie first — bypassing the DB entirely for same-browser persistence. The DB write (AJAX) remains as a best-effort layer for cross-device sync.

### 1.1.1
- **Fix:** Night mode preference now saves correctly on PHP 8.3 + SQLite. Kanboard's `MetadataModel::save()` calls `exists()` internally, which returns `true` on an empty table under PHP 8.3, causing silent `UPDATE` failures. `toggleNight()` now uses raw PicoDb `COUNT` + conditional `INSERT`/`UPDATE` to bypass the broken code path.

### 1.1.0
- Added Settings UI page (Settings → WrikeTheme) — configure logo, colors, and default task color without editing files
- Night mode preference now saved per-user in the database — no more flash on reload, syncs across devices
- Login page branding — logo and accent color applied to the login screen
- Default task color hook — configurable pre-selected color for new tasks
- Plugin version bumped to 1.1.0

### 1.0.0
- Initial release
- Wrike-inspired color palette (light mode)
- Night mode with localStorage persistence and OS preference fallback
- Prism.js syntax highlighting
- White task color option
- Back-to-top button
